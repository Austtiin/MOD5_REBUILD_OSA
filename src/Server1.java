* Overview:
Socket programming refers to writing programs that execute across multiple computers in which the devices are connected to each other through a network, specifically using the TCP or UDP protocols over TCP/IP. In this exercise, demonstrates how to write a client/server application in Java.



Instructions:
Write a Java program:

That emulates a client/server application running on your local host (127.0.0.1)
Where there is two-way communication between client and server: client sends message to server and server responds with acknowledgement and current date and time
Where server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, e.g., multiple threads running
Outputs client/server


Requirements:
Submit a compressed folder of your work. It should include:

Your annotated code
Screen captures of code execution
In 2-3 paragraphs, give a brief description of your results
